# CS61B

This repo contains my self-study attempt to *UC Berkeley CS61B*, whcih is the second course in CS61 series, that teaches **Data Structures and Algorithms**.

I am taking the [2021 version](https://sp21.datastructur.es/) of the course, because they made the [autograder](https://www.gradescope.com/) open sourced, just sign up with your name, UC Berkeley university, and the code **P5WVGW**.

The course uses Java to teach, and is composed of:

- 40 lectures
- 8 Labs
- 4 Projects
- 2 Midterms
- Final Exam

## Why taking CS61B

Data Structures and Algorithms are a vital subject to elevate your programming skills, and allow you to write more complex things.
> The difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether [the programmer] considers code or data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships. - Linus Torvalds (Creator of Linux)

## Notes

I am not much of a *notes guy*, that's why I prefer *getting your hands dirty courses*. But I stumbled upon this beautiful UCB courses notes called [Ben's Notes](https://notes.bencuan.me/cs61b/), I haven't read them yet but I think they will be a great asset when I start [CS70: Discrete Math](https://notes.bencuan.me/cs70/)  

## Data Structures Implementations

Some of the taught data structures (like dijoint sets) are not implemented in lectures neither in a lab as an assignment, my implementations to them and other Data Structures can be found [here](https://github.com/HsHs-dev/Algorithms)
