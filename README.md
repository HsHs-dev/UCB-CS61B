# CS61B

This repo contains my self-study attempt to *UC Berkeley CS61B*, whcih is the second course in CS61 series, that teaches **Data Structures and Algorithms**.

I am taking the 2021 version of the course, because they made the [autograder](https://www.gradescope.com/) open sourced, just sign up with your name, UC Berkeley university, and the code **P5WVGW**.

The course uses Java to teach, and is composed of:

- 40 lectures
- 14 Labs
- 4 Projects
- 2 Midterms
- Final Exam

## Why taking CS61B

Data Structures and Algorithms are a vital subject to elevate your programming skills, and allow you to write more complex things.
> The difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether [the programmer] considers code or data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships. - Linus Torvalds (Creator of Linux)
